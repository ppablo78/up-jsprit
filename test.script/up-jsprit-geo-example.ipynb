    "\n",
    "In this example, a simple Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is specified where some items are located in a certain places and two Vehicles are in charge to pickup and deliver them in the final depot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example shows how to:\n",
    "- define locations using latitude and longitude\n",
    "- define characteristics of the key actions:\n",
    "  - pickup:it represents the load of a good from a customer placed at a certain location to the vehicle\n",
    "  - delivery: it represents the unload of a good from a vehicle to the Customer placed in a certain location\n",
    "- define characteristics of the vehicle\n",
    "  - load capacity: the maximum capacity that can be loaded on a vehicle\n",
    "  - fixed cost: cost that does not depend on the travel distance\n",
    "  - variable cost: cost that depend on the travel distance\n",
    "- define characteristics of the item to be served:\n",
    "   - time window availability\n",
    "   - weight of each item\n",
    "   - time needed for completing the service (delivery or pickup)\n",
    "- manage the up-jpsrit library to solve the problem customizing the input parameters and the output, including the visualization on a georeferenced map.\n",
    " \n",
    "Opportunely combining these elements it is possible to build complex examples like: \n",
    "- **CVRP** (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem): it is a VRP in which Vehicles have a limited carrying capacity of the goods that must be delivered\n",
    "- **DVRP**P (Durative Vehicle Routing Problem): a classic VRP in which a duration is assigned to each action\n",
    "- **VRPTW** W (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window): it is a generalization of the VRP where the service at any customer starts within a given time interval, called a time wind\n",
    "- **MDVRP** (Multil Depot Vehicle Routing Problem): is a route optimization problem that involves selecting the most-effective route to deliver goods or services from multiple depots to a group of clients\n",
    "- **VRPD** (Vehicle Routing with Pickups and Deliveries) is a VRP in which the possibility that customers return some commodities is contemplated. In VRPPD itâ€™s needed to take into account that the goods that customers return to the delivery vehicle must fit into\n",
    "- **VRPBTW** (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Time Windows): involves the pickup and delivery of goods at different customer locations, with earliest and latest time deadlines, and varying demands. The demands are serviced using capacitated vehicles with limited route time. Moreover, all deliveries (linehauls) must be done before the pickups (backhauls)\n",
